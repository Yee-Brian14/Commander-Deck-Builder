# Commander-Deck-Builder
Commander recommender and deck builder for the Commander format in Magic: The Gathering (MTG).

## How can I get more people interested in this niche but growing format?
There are over 180,000 cards ever printed in MTG. The Commander format requires you to choose one legendary creature out of a possible 1000 to be the commander and then build a 99-card deck of unique cards themed around this commander. This is probably the hardest part of getting started in Commander and all the learning and fun starts after this step is completed. So to expidite this process, I decided to help people choose their legendary creature commander and then build a functioning and well-rounded deck around their chosen commander.
